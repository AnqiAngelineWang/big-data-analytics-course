  * Intersection
  * Projection
  * Selection
  * Union
* Inverted Index

* WordCount

# Folder Structure

1. hadoop-examples: `contains Hadoop programs developed in Java`.
2. spark-examples: `contains Spark developed in Python`.
3. inputs: `contains input data used in Hadoop and Spark examples`.
4. hadoop-output: `expected results from Hadoop programs`.
5. spark-output: `expected results from Spark programs`.

# Notes

* Java programs require Java 8
* Python programs require Python 3.
* Python version in each program as an environment variable.
